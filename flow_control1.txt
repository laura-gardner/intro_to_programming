Flow Control chapter exercise 1

1. false #correct
2. false #correct
3. false #correct
4. true #correct
5. true #correct
# (!true || (!(100 / 5) == 20) || ((328 / 4) == 82)) || false
# comparisons have highest precedence but we don't have any.
# equality come next so this evaluates to:
# (!true || false) || (true || false)
# finally comes logical OR so this evaluates to:
# false || true
# which finally evaluate to true.
