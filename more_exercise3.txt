Exception handling provides instructions for what to do in case of an exception or error
arising during execution of a program, for example, if a nil value is unexpectedly returned.
It stops the program stopping midway through execution if it encounters an error or something unexpected.
It has to be programmed in using reserved words begin, rescue and end.

So you would use exception handling to define the actions for the program to take if it encounters an error.
If it doesn't encounter an error, those instructions are never executed.
