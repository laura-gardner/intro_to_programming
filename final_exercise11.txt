I found the two official APIs:
http://ruby-doc.org/ and
http://api.rubyonrails.org/

I was a bit wary of the Ruby on Rails API as I don't know anything about Rails yet, and there wasn't
much there that I recognized.  For example, when I looked in the documentation for the Array
class, most of it looked very strange to me.  In contrast, the Ruby API is starting to look
familiar to me now, and I'm getting to the point where I understand what it's saying and can
follow the examples and then use the methods etc. in my code.
