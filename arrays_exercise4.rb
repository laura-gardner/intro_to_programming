# What does each method return in the following example?

arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

1. arr.index(5)
# Will return 3 (this is returning the index of 5, which is 3)

2. arr.index[5]
# From experimenting in irb I think this will generate an error message.

3. arr[5]
# This will return 8 (this is returning the value which has index 5)
